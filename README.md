## Requirements

The analysis is implemented in Python and utilizes several external libraries. For full compatibility, it is recommended to install the specific 
configuration listed below. However, stable upgraded versions of these libraries are also expected to work properly:

- Python 3.8.20  
- `numpy` 1.24.3  
- `scipy` 1.10.1  
- `pandas` 2.0.3  
- `matplotlib` 3.7.2  

---

## Dataset

The dataset is provided as an Excel file, `Data.xlsx`, which contains multiple sheets corresponding to different laboratory tests and material properties:

- **HTPG**: Measured HTPG of tank and recovered binders.
- **MSCR**: Measured recovery (e.g., $R_{3.2}$) and non-recoverable creep compliance (e.g., $J_{nr,3.2}$) parameters for tank and recovered binder at 64Â°C. 
- **Binder Frequency Sweep**: Detailed binder frequency sweep results at different temperatures ranging from 10Â°C to 82Â°C and loading frequencies ranging from 0.1 rad/s to 100 rad/s for all the tank and recovered binders at different aging levels.  

**NOTE**: **Tank binders** refer to the binders collected from the asphalt binder tank in the asphalt plant during the production of the mixtures for construction. However, **recovered binders** refer to the binders extracted and recovered from the loose mixtures sampled right behind the asphalt paver.

## Analysis Code

The analysis is organized into four Jupyter Notebooks:

- `Task01_Binder_HTPG.ipynb`: This notebook includes the codes to read, analyze, and plot the High-Temperature Performance Grade (HTPG) asphalt binders.
- `Task02_Binder_MSCR.ipynb`: This notebook includes the codes to read, analyze, and plot the Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) asphalt binders.
- `Task03_Binder_FrequencySweep.ipynb`: This notebook includes the codes to read, analyze, and plot the Zero-Shear Viscosity (ZSV) and Shenoy parameter for asphalt binders, based on the frequency sweep test results.
- `Task04_Binder_CorrelationStudy.ipynb`: This notebook includes the codes to evaluate the correlation between different parameters and plot a correlation graph.
